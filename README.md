# Orly Airpark Website Mockup

A lightweight front-end mockup of the Orly Airpark website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS,
and Vite for fast development and iteration. This project focuses on layout, visual
structure, and content flow rather than backend functionality.

---

## Overview

This project serves as a static prototype and design exploration for the Orly Airpark
website redesign. It provides a modern front-end setup using Vite for bundling and
Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling rapid UI iteration and clean structure.

The emphasis is on clarity, maintainability, and separation between editorial-style
content and operational aviation information.

---

## Purpose

The goals of this project are to:

- Mock up the redesigned Orly Airpark website experience
- Establish a clean, scalable front-end structure
- Enable fast visual iteration and layout experimentation
- Serve as a reference for future production implementation

---

## Features

- Vite-powered development environment
- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling
- Core layout and page structure
- Placeholder content and sections for rapid prototyping
- Responsive design foundation

Features can be expanded or replaced as the project evolves.

## Usage

This project can be used as:

- A visual mockup and prototype
- A front-end foundation for a production site
- A design exploration environment
- A reference layout for similar aviation or destination-style websites

---

## Customization

You are expected to:

- Replace placeholder content with real copy and media
- Adjust layout sections as needed
- Refine Tailwind styles to match branding
- Add interactivity or backend integrations later if required

The structure is intentionally lightweight to avoid early design lock-in.

---

## Project Structure

Typical structure includes:

- `index.html` – main entry point
- `src/` – assets and optional modular files
- `vite.config.js` – Vite bundler configuration

This may evolve as complexity increases.

## Notes

This repository represents a working mockup, not a final production build. Expect
structure, layout, and scope to evolve as design decisions are validated and refined.

Use this as a flexible foundation rather than a fixed template.
